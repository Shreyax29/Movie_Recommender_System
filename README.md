# Movie_Recommender_System

The Movie Recommender System has features like - 

1. When the user searches for a movie, it will provide the details of movie-name, genre, released date, status, IMDB rating. 

2. It recommends movie based on content-based. Similar content would be recommended to the user. For example - If the user watches a comedy movie, then the user will be recommended movies from comedy genre. It will recommend top 10 movies.

3. It will showcase the top cast to the user and their biographies when the user demands to know more about the actor.

4. It classifies the reviews using sentiment analysis and shows the Negative and Positive ratios, as Good or Bad from top 10 reviews. It’s unique from existing ones like IMDB, because IMDB shows percentage of likes and dislikes basd on number of users clicking the like and dislike button. It doesn’t show any sentiment classification of reviews to the users, IMDB does sentiment analysis for business purpose not to show its result to end users. Hence Our model eventually reduces probability of un-reliable likes and dislikes ratio.
